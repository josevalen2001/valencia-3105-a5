Welcome to my personal inventory manager application!

In this readme file I will attempt to explain how to use each function available in my application.

1. The user can add a new item to their personal inventory by providing a serial number, name and value 
for the item in the text fields provided and then clicking the add item button. There has to be a valid 
serial number, name and value for a new task in the text fields for this function to work.

2. The user can remove an item from their personal inventory by selecting the item they wish to remove
in the table view and then clicking the remove button. There has to be an item selected for this function
to work. Any and every item can be removed.

3. The user can edit the serial number, name and value of an already existing item by selecting the item
in the table view, providing the new serial number, name and value for the item and clicking the edit item
button. There has to be a valid serial number, name and value in the text fields for this function to work.
The new serial number cannot be repeated, but the new name and value can be repeated.

4. The user can sort the inventory by serial number, value or name by simplpy clicking one of the sort
buttons in the application.

5. The user can search for an item(s) name or serial number in the inventory by providing a name or serial
number to search and clicking one of the search buttons. Click the view all button to go back to viewing all
items.

6. The user can export their inventory to a desired location by providing a location and name for the file
in the text fields and clicking either of the export buttons depending on if they would like their file
exported as a .txt file or .html file. Please enter a location for the file like in this example: 
"C:\Users\Jose\OneDrive\Documents" (no quotations).
